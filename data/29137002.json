    "story": "Momo is a 3 year old DSH from Animal Humane Society. She weighs 8-10 lbs. She is the sweetest little kitty and enjoys getting pets, head scratches, cuddles in bed, and lots of love from her human. She is an extremely affectionate cat and will accept everyone - it doesn't matter who, she will enjoy getting pets. She is easy to take care of - no litterbox issues, no scratching, no major health problems, likes independent play, can be alone for long periods of time (for owners who are busy and have jobs/school), and she loves running up to you and greeting you whenever you come back home. She is very vocal and meows and chirps a lot, especially when it comes to food. Her favorite toy is anything small and random. No small/random object is safe from this little hunter. Aluminum foil balls, hair bands, pieces of lettuce - Momo will hunt and catch them all.\n\nShe does not do well with other cats and dogs and can live with first-time cat owners and apartment dwellers.",
