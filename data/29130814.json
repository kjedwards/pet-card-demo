  "story": "Felix is friendly, chill and happy. He loves being around people but also enjoys long naps by himself. He is small but mighty—weighing in at only 7 pounds. Felix loves to be held which is proven by his extra loud purr. He is also quite the athlete. I've never seen a cat jump so high! The perfect home for Felix would be one without other cats.",
