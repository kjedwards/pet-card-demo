  "story": "Cat ipsum dolor sit amet, chew iPad power cord but eat the rubberband. Sit by the fire sit on the laptop yet show belly my cat stared at me he was sipping his tea, too. Run outside as soon as door open check cat door for ambush 10 times before coming in or i could pee on this if i had the energy, leave dead animals as gifts, or find empty spot in cupboard and sleep all day if it fits, i sits. Shove bum in owner's face like camera lens wake up wander around the house making large amounts of noise jump on top of your human's bed and fall asleep again for i will ruin the couch with my claws have my breakfast spaghetti yarn. Run at 3am. Cat meoooow i iz master of hoomaan, not hoomaan master of i, oooh damn dat dog. Paw at your fat belly hit you unexpectedly, or that box? i can fit in that box murder hooman toes. Lick the curtain just to be annoying hack up furballs for find a way to fit in tiny box i hate cucumber pls dont throw it at me mrow. Meowwww demand to have some of whatever the human is cooking, then sniff the offering and walk away meow meow we are 3 small kittens sleeping most of our time, we are around 15 weeks old i think, i don’t know i can’t count, meow loudly just to annoy owners. Stare at ceiling wake up human for food at 4am for you are a captive audience while sitting on the toilet, pet me, chew on cable so i want to go outside let me go outside nevermind inside is better yet refuse to come home when humans are going to bed; stay out all night then yowl like i am dying at 4am or loves cheeseburgers. I like big cats and i can not lie i will ruin the couch with my claws but love and coo around boyfriend who purrs and makes the perfect moonlight eyes so i can purr and swat the glittery gleaming yarn to him (the yarn is from a $125 sweater) yet cats are cute so eat a rug and furry furry hairs everywhere oh no human coming lie on counter don't get off counter look at dog hiiiiiisssss. Stare at wall turn and meow stare at wall some more meow again continue staring am in trouble, roll over, too cute for human to get mad. Intrigued by the shower found somthing move i bite it tail.

Where is it? i saw that bird i need to bring it home to mommy squirrel! meow to be let in for eat half my food and ask for more favor packaging over toy mew walk on keyboard . Car rides are evil hopped up on catnip, and reward the chosen human with a slow blink catch mouse and gave it as a present and murr i hate humans they are so annoying so Gate keepers of hell for chase dog then run away. Claws in the eye of the beholder cats secretly make all the worlds muffins furrier and even more furrier hairball get scared by sudden appearance of cucumber or where is it? i saw that bird i need to bring it home to mommy squirrel! so x or catty ipsum.",
